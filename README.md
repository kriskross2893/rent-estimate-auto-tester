# README

This project is all about generating a csv file that will showcase which properties will most likely have a rent estimate.

## Setup

This project will only be a backend system built using ExpressJS.

## How it works

It will essentially pull all available listings from database and then generate a csv file from that.

After generating the csv file it will hit a backend service that will retrieve all the necessary information for each listing.

It will export this new output into a new csv file named - rent-estimates.csv
